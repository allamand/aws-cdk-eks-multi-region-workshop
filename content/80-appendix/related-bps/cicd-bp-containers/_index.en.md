In AWS re:invent 2019, there was a session about Best Practices in Containerized environment. This session mainly covers ECS and Fargate, but there were a plenty of things which also works for Kubernetes environments as well. This workshop takes a few points out of this session which are:

- Container Image tagging: Manage docker images by the image tags of Git commit hash.
- Application repository even takes care of related infrastructure resources such as how many replicas or what types of service exposure this app would have.
