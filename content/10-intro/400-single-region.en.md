In this lab, we write a construct to provision EKS cluster with re-usable ones that CDK provides. We would also write another to provision K8S resources. This enables you to manage Infrastructure and Long-running containers at one view!

If you are not interested in spreading EKS cluster into different regions, please feel free to stop at Lab 1.
