This workshop is designed for Developers who begins their cloud journey with limited experience of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). If you are one of the following, you will find this workshop helpful:

* who start to learn IaC
* who plan to use EKS
* who wants to deploy the best practice that AWS proposes with minimum effort
* who wants to expand the EKS workloads into another region

This workshop assumes you already know the following:
* Basic concepts of containers and Kubernetes in general (docker build, docker push, Kubernetes pod, service, context...)
* What AWS Core services (IAM, EC2, VPC) are
* What EKS is and why you want to use it
* Typescript and Object oriented programming (you do not have to be Typescript expert if you are familiar with object oriented programming)
